1.  A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered.

2. Difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin Blockchain:

- The Bitcoin blockchain was created in 2008 as a P2P (peer-to-peer) electronic cash transaction system, which means all intermediaries were eliminated and there was no central governing body. 

- Ethereum blockchain uses smart contracts which is a set of codes to perform predetermined tasks with actions triggered by conditions such as the passing of an expiration date, on reaching a particular price, etc.

- Bitcoin blockchain is slower than the ethereum chain because of the block size.

- Bitcoin uses the proof of work POWprotocol, while ethereum uses the proof of stake, POS

3. 5 Uses of Blockchain technology:

-. Smart Contracts
Smart contracts Blockchain-based contracts enforced in real-time. They are created as an agreement between two or more parties without the involvement of any intermediary. The contract exists across a distributed and decentralized Blockchain network. Smart contracts are now a staple in healthcare, real estate, and even for government agencies. 

- Internet of Things (IoT)
 By integrating Blockchain technology in IoT devices, the possibility of data breaches can be reduced to a great extent. 

- Money Transfer
Money transfer and payment processing are the most excellent Blockchain technology use cases. Blockchain tech enables lightning-fast transactions in real-time. 

- Personal Identity Security: Blockchain can help combat this menace by storing crucial personal information (for example, social security numbers, birth certificates, address, PAN, etc.) on a decentralized and immutable ledger.

- Logistics: Blockchain technology is extensively used in the logistics industry for effectively tracking the goodâ€™s movement over multiple locations.
